When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- For working with other people mainly.
- Could also function as a way to store projects online when switching computers or simply as a backup.
- For work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- So you can control what goes public or doesn't

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Forks:
	- A github clone of a repository. Basically the same as git clone <link> - just on github instead of locally
- Clones:
	- Cloning a repository to your computer
	- Sets up a link to this
- Branches:
	- Like the master branch. A way to use/create experimental code eg.
