When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- For working with other people mainly.
- Could also function as a way to store projects online when switching computers or simply as a backup.
- For work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- So you can control what goes public or doesn't
